# Titanic_kaggle

This notebook is my solution to the titanic problem. I have used some visualizations to get the insights of data. There is a lot of scope for improvement still. I used xgboost for classification with default parameters. I got 79% accuracy on the test set. Will continue to do the improvements in model.
